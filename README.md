#FAQ
    I get weird errors from phantom when I try to run it?
This is probably due to bad dependencies in phantom, to fix this cd into node_modules/phantom and edit package.json so that all of the dependencies are <= instead of ~. The newer version of some node modules causes phantom to fail. Now run npm install while still inside the phantom directory, this should install the proper dependencies.
